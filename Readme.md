# Function to read and concatenate multiple files into a single


The function was created for the purpose of reading and concatenating multiple files of the same format into a single file and then saving it to a folder so that we could then perform an exploratory analysis.

# Why create this function?

The idea of creating this function was based on the need to analyze numerous log files, so as a starting point I chose to concatenate the files to facilitate later analysis, with this task automation saves time and avoids manual errors.
